1. To run the program, two text files named 'Suppliers.txt' and 'items.txt' should be in the same folder where java files are.
2. Each time user presses 5, the item is automatically decreased by a quantity of 1. And the order is printed to the console.
3. Class 'Shop' constructor passes the names for the text files that are to be read i.e. "Suppliers.txt' and 'items.txt'.
4. After running the code, follow the instructions that will be displayed on the console.
5. If user enters the wrong input then he will be displayed with the list of operation, following which he can continue again with that operation. 
6. Code will continue to run until user presses 6, which exits the code.
7. The design used to implement the Tool Shop is the one described in the lectures. Only difference is that between Order and OrderLines it is one way association instead of aggregation(It was told in lectures that aggregation can be changed to one way association).
